# Live Face Recogition - London Studios
**Live Face Recognition** is a **FiveM** resource allowing you to setup a live face recognition zone around a vehicle, often a van. The plugin creates a camera on top of the vehicle and places two signs around the vehicle, warning people of the use of face recognition.

If a person adds themselves to the system, the camera will take a photo to them and show officers there has been an activation - with the offence they are wanted for.

This is used by the Met Police (UK) and other forces around the world. After researching, their systems only ping for people who are wanted for a serious offence, so if you use this - try to keep it to that.

**Please note:** The camera will not work with all vehicles.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm, SmartObservations and more!	

## Usage
**/lfr [setup / remove]** - Setup or remove a live face recognition camera. You may only have one at once and you must be inside a vehicle to set one up. Make sure the area in front of the vehicle and behind are clear, as a sign will spawn there.

**/facedetect [FirstName] [LastName] [Notes/Wanted for.......]** - Add yourself to the face recognition system as a civilian. You can change your name just by doing the command again, great for changing characters. If you walk past one of these cameras after performing the command, the camera will take a photo of you, showing officers your name and the offence you are wanted for.
